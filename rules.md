How to play
===========

No More Spcae is played in turns. The starting player takes the first turn, and turns continue clockwise around the table. The game ends when the Action tiles run out and everyone has used every action in their hand.


Taking a turn
-------------

On your turn you can do one of the following:

1. Place a new space ship on the board.

2. Play an Action tile from your hand.

3. Discard an Action tile and Mine with your space ships.

After doing one of the actions, your turn is over and the turn passes to the player on your left.


1. Place a new space ship on the board
---------------------------------------

Place one of your space ships on the board in a free spot. If there is no tile nor ship on the square, that square is considered free. If an asteroid doesn't have any minerals left on it, it is removed from the board and that square is free to place new ships on.

When placing down a space ship you may rotate it any direction you want.

2. Play an Action tile from your hand
-------------------------------------

Take a Action tile from your hand, show it to all players and resolve it's effect. 

Discard the Action tile. Draw another Action tile from the deck, so that you'll have 3 Action tiles in your hand.


3. Mine with your space ships
-----------------------------

Select a card from your hand, place it face up in the discard pile. This card is discarded and not played. 

All your Ships on the board now mine. 

1. Ship with the number 1 on it. The ship mines 1 mineral from all the 4 adjacent tiles. Remove 1 mineral from all the four adjacent tiles (if they have minerals) and place them in your mineral bank. If there are no minerals in any of the 4 adjacent tiles, then you get nothing from that ship.

If an asteroid is mined empty remove that asteroid tile form the board. That square of the board is now free for others to enter. 

2. Ship with the number 2 on it. The ship mines 2 minerals from both left hand and right hand sides of the ship. Remove 2 minerals from the 2 tiles (if they have minerals) and place them in your mineral bank.

3. Ship with the number 3 on it. The ship mines 3 minerals from the left hand tile. If there are any minerals on the card. Remove up to 3 from that tile and place those into your mineral bank.
