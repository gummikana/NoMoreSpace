=============

A game about mining minerals from asteroids.


Objective

The goal is to have most minerals at the end of the game. The game ends when the Action tiles have run out. 


Terms
-----
mineral bank

Components
==========

* 23 Action tiles (7x Activation!, 3x Rotation, 3x Warp, 3x Double Activation, 2x Magnet, 3x Bulldozer, 2x Teleporter) 
* 31 Space tiles (4x Empty, 11x Asteroid 1, 6x Asteroid 2, 2x Asteroid 3, 1x Asteroid 4, 1x Asteroid 5, 2x Worm Hole, 2x Bomb, 2x Deathstar)
* 9 Mining ships (3 for each player)

* 1 Space board
* 1 Rule booklet


Setup
=====

Take the Space board and lay it at the center of the table.

Each player takes their 3 ships and places them in front of them.

*) Remove X Activation tiles at the beginning.
Take the Action tiles and shuffle them. Deal 3 action tiles to each player, these are the starting hands.

Take the Space tiles and shuffle them and cut a pile to each player. Players lay the tiles face down on the board. After all the tiles have been randomly distributed on the Board, flip all the tiles face up. Remove the Empty space tiles. Add Mineral cubes on the Asteroid up to the number indicated on the Asteroid.

If a player flips up a Deathstar, they may orient it in any way they desire.

How to play
===========

No More Space is played in turns. The starting player takes the first turn, and turns continue clockwise around the table. The game ends when the Action tiles run out and everyone has used every Action tile in their hand.


Taking a turn
-------------

On your turn you can do _one_ of the following:

1. Place a new space ship on the board.

2. Play an Action tile from your hand.

3. Discard an Action tile to Mine with your space ships.

After doing one of the actions, your turn is over and the turn passes to the player on your left.


1. Place a new space ship on the board
---------------------------------------

Place one of your space ships on the board in a free spot. If there is no tile nor ship on the square, that square is considered free. If an asteroid doesn't have any minerals left on it, it is removed from the board and thus becomes free.

When placing down a space ship you may rotate it any direction you want.

2. Play an Action tile from your hand
-------------------------------------

Take a Action tile from your hand, show it to all players and resolve it's effect. 

Discard the Action tile, unless it is a Bulldozer or a Magnet. Draw another Action tile from the deck, so that you'll have 3 Action tiles in your hand.


3. Mine with your space ships
-----------------------------

Select an Action tile from your hand, place it face up in the discard pile. This card is discarded and not played. 

All your Ships on the board now mine. 

1. Ship with the number 1 on it. The ship mines 1 mineral from all the 4 adjacent squares. Remove 1 mineral from all the four adjacent squares (if they have minerals) and place them in your mineral bank. If there are no minerals in any of the 4 adjacent squares, then you get nothing from that square.

2. Ship with the number 2 on it. The ship mines 2 minerals from both left hand and right hand sides of the ship. Remove 2 minerals from the 2 Squares (if they have minerals) and place them in your mineral bank.

3. Ship with the number 3 on it. The ship mines 3 minerals from the left hand or the right hand (depending on the ship) Square. If there are any minerals on the card. Remove up to 3 from that tile and place those into your mineral bank.

Remember that, if an asteroid is mined empty remove that asteroid tile form the board. 

Draw another Action tile, so that you'll have 3 Action tiles in your hand.


Action tiles
============

Rotation tile
-------------

When playing the rotation tile, select one of the space ships (either one of your one, or one of the enemies) or any of the other tile on the board. You can rotate the selected tile into any orientation you choose, but you must keep the tile at the same square it currently is at.

Discard the Rotation tile after use.

Teleportation device
--------------------

When playing the Teleportation device, select on of the tiles on the board (excluding the Black hole) and move it to any other free square on the board, but you cannot rotate the tile while moving it.

Discard the Teleportation device after use.

E.g. John decides to teleport Mary's ship #3 out of the Asteroid to keep it from mining the minerals from it. 

WARP!
-----

When playing the WARP!, select one of the tiles with an engine (one of your space ships, one of your enemies space ships or a Bulldozer) and it jumps 2 squares ahead in the direction that the space ship is traveling. If the tile 2 squares ahead is occupied you cannot use WARP! on that tile. Using WARP! you can jump over the tile directly ahead of the ship. If there is a black hole at the destination, you may WARP! the ship to the black hole and then that ship is removed from the game.

Discard the WARP! tile after use.

Magnet
------

Magnet's can be used to move groups of tiles on the board. 

When playing a Magnet tile select a free square on the board and place the Magnet tile there in any orientation. The magnet is activated immediately after it's been placed.

Activating the Magnet. The Magnet pulls towards itself all the metal tiles (Ships, Deathstar, Bomb, Bulldozer) on the same line that magnet is on. The Magnet's rays also wrap around the edges of the board. The metal tiles slide towards the magnet until they either hit the magnet or another tile (e.g. an Asteroid). If a tile is pulled into the Black hole it is destroyed and removed from the game.

*) Explain Black hole and multiple ships...

The Magnet tile stays on the board and can be reactivated with an Activation tile.

Bulldozer
---------

Bulldozer's can be used to move groups of tiles on the board and to combine Minerals into bigger piles of Minerals. 

When playing the Bulldozer tile select a free square on the board and place the Bulldozer tile there in any orientation. The Bulldozer is activated immediately after it's been placed.

Activating the Bulldozer: The Bulldozer pushes forward 1 tile and pushes over all the other tiles in the same line that it is. The 2 things Bulldozer's can move are Black holes and another Bulldozers. 

Activation Tile
---------------

When playing the Activation tile, select one another tile on the board that can be activated (Ships, Bulldozer, Deathstar, Bomb, Magnet). Perform that tiles Activation effect.

Ships Activation, if a Ship is activated it moves forward 1 tile (if the destination tile is free). If a Ship moves into the Black hole it is destroyed and removed from the game. 

If a Bulldozer or Magnet are activated perform their Activations described above.

Activating the Deathstar. The Deathstar fires a laser beam that travels forward and destroys what ever tile it hits first (with the exception of the Black hole). A Deathstar can't destroy itself but it can destroy the other Deathstar.

*) Figure out what happens when Deathstar fires into the Black hole. If the Deathstar fires into Black hole, the laser comes out of the other Black hole. 

Activating the Bomb. The Bomb explodes and destroys all the 4 adjacent tiles. If a Bomb is ever destroyed (with the exception of being destroyed by the Black hole) it explodes and destroys the 4 adjacent tiles. These tiles and their minerals are removed from the game.

Discard the Activation tile after it's use.

Double Activation Tile
----------------------

Double Activation Tile is just like Activation Tile, except it allows you to perform 2 Activations. Select 2 tiles (or the same twice) and perform their Activation effect.
